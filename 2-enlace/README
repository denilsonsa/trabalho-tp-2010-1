== Compiling ==

Just run 'make'.

For convenience, all executables will be saved at the package root
directory (the same dir where the Makefile is located).

The code has been tested under Gentoo/Linux x86_64, with gcc-4.4.3, and
compiles with no warnings.


== Running ==

For each compiled program, run it without parameters to print the
built-in help.

  ./fisica-teste
  # will print built-in help

In order to test each program, you usually need to run multiple
instances at the same time, each one in a different terminal. With the
intention of simplifying testing, there are some handy scripts at the
"run/" directory.

Thus, just run:
  ./run/fisica-teste.sh
  # or any other script from that directory

Those scripts use 'xterm' as the terminal. If you don't have 'xterm, you
can either install it, or edit "run/common.sh" to point to the terminal
of your preference.

Of course, you are free to manually run each program without using the
scripts. You can also run each program on a different machine, just pass
the correct parameters so they will find each other.


== Directories ==

lib/
  All code shared between multiple programs is inside this directory.

src/
  Each program has its source here.

run/
  Handy scripts for running common test cases. These scripts open
  multiple "xterm" windows, one for each program instance.


== Shared network-related files ==

lib/fisica.*
  Implements a physical layer on top of UDP sockets.

lib/enlace.*
  Implements the link layer.


== Shared auxiliar files ==

lib/nbiocore.*
  Non-blocking I/O core. Makes it easier to use "select()" system call,
  by registering callback functions for each file descriptor to be read.

  (now that I think about it... only input is handled, thus it should
  have been called NBI core)

lib/terminal.*
  Code that changes the terminal flags, in order to set non-canonical
  mode (unbuffered, per-character input).

lib/util.*
  Small, simple and handy functions that might be used in multiple
  places.
