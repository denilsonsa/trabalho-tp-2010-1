== Compiling ==

Just run 'make'.

All code shared between multiple programs is inside the "lib/"
directory. The source code for each program is inside "src/" directory.
For convenience, running "make" will build the final executable at the
package root directory (the same dir where Makefile is located).

The code has been tested under Linux with gcc-4.4.3, and compiles with
no warnings.


== Running ==

Run without parameters to print the built-in help:
  ./fisica-teste

Run these two commands at different terminals at the same machine:
  ./fisica-teste 1234 :1235
  ./fisica-teste 1235 :1234

For details, read fisica-relat.pdf (in Portuguese).
